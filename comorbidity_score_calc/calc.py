        # A helper function

        Checks if any codes in 'icd_codes' ((the input codes)) correspond to a code in the 'code_group' ((from the list in the script's JSON file)) based on the specified condition.
        There are two possible ways the input codes are processed and checked:
            1. The first way is the more intuitive one and checks for exact matches, i.e. an input code K70.1 will only score if
               there is K70.1 in the selected mapping.
            2. The other way is checking for prefixes. This means that if only K70 is present in the script's library, all its 
               extensions/subcodes will also score, like K70.1, K70.99, etc. This is meant for the situations where additional codes
               are added to the ICD Codes list and coded for a patient but are not yet implemented in this script's library.
               Theoretically, this should not lead to any discrepancies in the final score, as the superior codes are only there in
               the library if all the subcodes are also meant to score.
               For the above reasons this is the default way the script works and if the user

        Parameters
        ----------
        icd_codes : Union[str, List[str]]
            A single ICD code or a list of ICD codes to check for matches.
        code_group : dict
            A dictionary containing a "condition" key (either 'any' or 'both') and a list of 'codes' or 'code groups' to check for matches.
            The structure of 'code_group' is:
                {
                    "condition": "any" | "both",
                    "codes": [list of codes or groups of codes]
                }

        Returns
        -------
        bool:
            True if the condition is met ('any' or 'both'), False otherwise.

        The 'any' condition returns True if any of the codes in 'icd_codes' starts with any, or matches directly, a code from the 'codes' list.
        The 'both' condition returns True only if there is at least one matching prefix, or exact code, in each subgroup of the 'codes' list.

        Calculates the chosen Comorbidity Score
        For now, only the Charlson Comorbidity Index (Deyo modification) is available.
        The score is calculated based on a given set of ICD codes and a mapping file ('codes.json')

        The score is determined by matching the ICD codes provided to specific categories in a predefined mapping file.
        By default, it calculated the CCI based on the ICD10-2024-GM codes, but alternate mappings (such as Quan's modification) are also available.

        Parameters
        ----------
        icd_codes : Union[str, list]
            A single ICD code or a list of ICD codes that will be evaluated for comorbidities.
        mapping : str, optional
            Identifier for the version of the ICD code mapping to be used. Valid options include:
            - "cci_icd2024gm"         : the 2024 version of the German Modification ICD-10 codes, mapped by the algorithm authors.
            - "cci_icd2024gm_quan"    : a variation based on Quan's implementation, applied to the 2024 ICD-10 GM codes.
            - "cci_icd_quan_orig"     : Quan's mapping, as presented and explained in the following paper , DOI: 10.1097/01.mlr.0000182534.19832.83
        exact_codes : bool, optional
            If True, checks for exact matches between ICD codes and the mapping data. If False, checks for prefix matches. Default is False, meaning
            that if any of the codes in the selected mapping list starts with any of the input codes, it scores

        Returns
        -------
        tuple: (score: int, categories: list)
        - score: An integer representing the total comorbidity score (for CCI it ranges from 0 to 29).
        - categories: A list of categories (comorbidities) that scored based on the input ICD codes.

        Notes
        -----
        - Each category in the CCI has a 'weight' in the mapping file which, contributes to the total score.
        - If multiple comorbidities are present (e.g., neoplasm and metastatic disease), in CCI, only the more severe condition contributes to the score.
        - The 'depends_on' field in the mapping file specifies these hierarchies. For example, if 'dm_simple' depends on 'dm_complicated', 
        the simpler condition will not contribute to the score if the more severe condition is present.
